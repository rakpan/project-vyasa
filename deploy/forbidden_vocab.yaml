# Forbidden Vocabulary Configuration for Project Vyasa
#
# Purpose:
# Enforce precise, defensible, non-marketing language suitable for
# attorney-style, architectural, and academic write-ups.
#
# Guidance:
# - Avoid overstatement, consultancy fluff, and unverifiable claims
# - Prefer neutral, observable, or testable language
# - Alternatives are intentionally conservative
